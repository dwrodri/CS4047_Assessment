This is a fuzzy logic system influenced by the [Tsukamoto model](http://researchhubs.com/post/engineering/fuzzy-system/tsukamoto-fuzzy-model.html) for fuzzy-rule-based systems.

## Structure

The parse reads in the rulebase, followed by the sets, followed by the input values that the set is to be tested with. See the test files for reference. 

## Design
