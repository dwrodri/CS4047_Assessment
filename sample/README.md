# CS4047_Assessment

This is a basic fuzzy rule framework that maps fuzzy sets to rules defined in "if-then" format in a text file. I made this for a school project.

## Structure

The parse reads in the rulebase, followed by the sets, followed by the input values that the set is to be tested with. See the test files for reference.
